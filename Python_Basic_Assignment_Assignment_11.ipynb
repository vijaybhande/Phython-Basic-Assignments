    "8. Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "Ans: Using logging messages is better than using print() because logging allows for more granular control over the messages severity levels, destination (console, file, etc.), and formatting. It also makes it easier to manage and analyze logs, especially in large and complex software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "Step Over: Executes the current line of code and stops at the next line, without stepping into any function calls on that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step In: If the current line of code contains a function call, it steps into that function and stops at the first line of code inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Out: Continues execution until the current function returns, then stops at the line of code immediately after the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "Ans: After clicking Continue, the debugger will stop when it encounters the next breakpoint or when the program execution finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "Ans: A breakpoint is a designated point in the code where program execution will pause so that you can inspect variables, step through code, and debug issues. Breakpoints are set by the developer to control the flow of the debugger during execution.\n"
