    "1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "Ans:shutil.copy() is used to copy a single file from one location to another,\n",
    "shutil.copytree() is used to recursively copy an entire directory tree from one location to another.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "Ans:The delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules differ in their approach. \n",
    "The send2trash module sends files or directories to the operating system's trash or recycle bin, allowing for easy recovery if needed, while the shutil module permanently deletes files or directories from the file system.\n",

    "4. ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "Ans: The equivalent method in ZipFile objects to File objects' open() method is the ZipFile() constructor. This method is used to create a new ZipFile object, which can then be used to interact with zip archive files.\n"
